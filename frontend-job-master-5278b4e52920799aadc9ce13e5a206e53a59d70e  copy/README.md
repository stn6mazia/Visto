The challenge is to create a modern web application with pages to display static content, POST to API, plus as a bonus, listing, editing, and deleting the created resource .

This project has a suggestion to implement this application using React, Redux and Webpack. But it is optional to use it, feel free to create otherwise equivalent.

The test **questions.js** must be made and validated by automated tests.

In addition to the web application React, this project has the API server, which stores the data in a local JSON. Once started, the API documentation can be viewed in [http://localhost:3001/documentation](http://localhost:3001/documentation)
